    <h1>Information Sheet: Visualization Experiment</h1>
      <p>Students: Hasan Nofal, Mohid Chaudhry, Fathan Raedaya and Jonathan Sutanto</p>
      <p>Address: School of Computing, University of Leeds</p>
      <p>We are a group of students at the University of Leeds, interested in how to design visualizations of descriptive
      statistics. If you volunteer for the experiment you will perform a series of trials. The order in which
      you perform the trials will depend on the group to which you are allocated. Each trial will show a
      grid of visualizations, and your task is to indicate which visualization is an anomaly.
      The experiment will take approximately 1Â½ hours. Your responses will be recorded, but you will
      remain anonymous. The research may be reported in student work, but no-one should be able to
      identify you and at no point will your identity be divulged.</p>
      <p>By taking part in the experiment you are indicating informed consent. You are free to withdraw from
      the experiment at any time.</p>
      <p>Finally, please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss anything with us, you can find our contact information <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>
